### RCB Mode: A slightly different approach to the SCB 

Inspired by the Secure Codebook (SCB) mode of operation, the **Randomised Codebook (RCB)** modifies the SCB slightly in order to achieve even better security with neglible cost of less correctness. 
The SCB was described by ETH ZÃ¼rich researcher Fabio Banfi in a paper appearing in [IACR Transactions on Symmetric Cryptology, Volume 2022, Issue 4](https://tosc.iacr.org/index.php/ToSC/article/view/9970), 
and it is the first length-preserving encryption scheme that does achieve semantic security while allowing for imperfect decryption. Those imperfections happen with only negligible 
probability if the parameter tao and sigma necessary for the mode are chosen with care. ... explain how RCB is different
